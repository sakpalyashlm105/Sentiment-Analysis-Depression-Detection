# Sentiment-Analysis-Depression-Detection

This repository contains code and data for conducting sentiment analysis on a Twitter dataset of 20,000 English tweets to predict depression using AI. The project aims to analyze the emotional tone of tweets and classify users' mental health status based on sentiment scores.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of 20,000 English tweets collected via the Twitter API and Kaggle. Each tweet is labeled as either "depressed" or "non-depressed." The tweets have been preprocessed to retain only English content and underwent text cleaning to remove punctuation, numbers, and stop words.

## Sentiment Analysis and Model Selection
The sentiment analysis task was carried out using various machine learning classifiers to predict depression based on the emotional content of tweets. The following classifiers were explored:

Decision Tree Classifier: Achieved a high accuracy of 94.2% for depression detection on the test data.
Random Forest Classifier: Demonstrated potential effectiveness with 92.88% accuracy for sentiment analysis and depression prediction.
KNN Classifier: Achieved an accuracy rate of 84.58%, showing its suitability for sentiment analysis tasks.
Naive Bayes Classifier: Achieved an accuracy of 88.2%, indicating its effectiveness in depression prediction.

## Results
The project showcases the potential of machine learning algorithms in predicting depression based on the sentiment scores derived from Twitter data. The achieved accuracy rates and performance metrics demonstrate the effectiveness of the selected classifiers for sentiment analysis and depression detection.
